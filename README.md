# Jack-Compiler

A compiler written in C++ for the Jack language used in the nand2tetris course. The supplied Jack code is compiled into intermediate virtual-machine code, which can then be translated into any platform-specific assembly code provided that such translator exists.



Note: For now, the compiler assumes that the Jack code is error free. This may or may not change in the future.
